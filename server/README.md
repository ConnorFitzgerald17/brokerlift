# Server

## Project setup

This is the setup for the server side of the brokerlift coding assessment

Once you have cloned the repo you should run the following command in the terminalfrom the server `root` to make sure you have all necessary dependencies.

```bash
$ npm install
```

Once that is done you should create a `.env` file in the `root` of the server folder. Inside you need to create the following variable: (See email for connection string)

```
MONGO_URL=<connection_string>
```

## Running the app

After these steps have been followed you will need to run the following command in the terminal:

```bash
$ npm run start
```
